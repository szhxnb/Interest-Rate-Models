## Introduction 

This site has been created to summarize my understanding of Interest Rate Models. 

There are 3 most popular methods to model Interest Rate. With an increasing practicability, they are: 
- Short Rate Models 
- Instantaneous Forward Rate Models 
- Market Models

Before discussing any model, some basic knowledge needs to be reinforced. 

After that, three dimensions are used to illustrate each one of the three methods: 
- A chronicle showing the evolution of Interest Rate Models from the first to the third method
- A derivation for each single model being discussed
- A simulation for the stochastic differential equation or an implementation for the analytical formula derived from each single model

5. Market Models

Please be aware that my research might not be accurate or complete. There will definitely be some good models not mentioned here. 

You are welcomed to share any insights and make appropriate corrections.
