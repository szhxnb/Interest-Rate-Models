## Evolution of Interest Rate Models 

With decent understanding of everything mentioned in the basics, here the story begins. 

### Short Rate Models 

It should start with the short rate () modeling. In a time-homogeneous risk-neutral equillibrium market, we first have a derivation of the generalized term-structure from Vasicek at 1977. 

A special case is derived to show the market equillibrium following a Ornstein-Uhlenback process which is equivalent to a stationary Gauss-Markov process. Based on my understanding, equillibrium here means a stable bond price or equivalently a stable interest rate based on supply and demand of the underlyings. This is also the reason that this special case is a mean-reverting process. This special case has a form: 

  is risk-neutral Stochastic Brownian Motion and  is following Normal Distribution. 

If we want a calibration for zero coupon bond price, we derive it using Feynman-Kac. Solving the PDE gives us an Affine Term-Structure Model.
