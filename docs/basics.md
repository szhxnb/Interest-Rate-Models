## Basics Review 

Before jumping into any actual content, we have to be familiar with the following aspects: 
- Rates Conversion
- Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing
- Ito's Formulas

Each aspect will be crucial for us to set up a universe with stable assumptions to solve the differential equations and solve for analytical formulas. 

For example, rates conversion is needed when you want to pricing formula with a short rate function. Fundamental Theorem is definitely used to ensure arbitrage free so we can solve the functions by change of risk-neutral measure. Ito's formulas are the foundations for us to solve any differentials mentioned.
